# SpaceShip-Attack

Using reinforcement learning to train a Neural Network to learn to play a SpaceShip game.

Training of the model :-

Game can be found at (Human input) : https://github.com/AwsManas/SpaceShip-Attack

The file model.py consist of defination of our neural network model. 
The file agent.py consist of a class that talks between model and the game and trains the neural network using Reinforcement Learning.
the file shooterAI.py constains a class that allows interaction of agent to play the game build using pygame. 

Please run the file agent.py to start the training.
